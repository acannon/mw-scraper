# mw-scraper
A web scraper built to find pronunciations from Merriam-Webster webpages

# Purpose
This project was built to introduce myself to Python, explor web scrapers, HTML parsing, and the [BeautifulSoup Python library](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), as well as practice file handling. 

# Use
The program takes a list of "terms" (words which you want pronunciation for) and creates two separate files - one with the diacritc pronunciation markers and one with the URL to the term. Currently, the input file must be specified in the code. The user will not be prompted for a file name. The default file name it will look for is input.txt.

# Disclaimer
To the best of my knowledge, this code is not currently in use by me or anyone else. I do not recommend running web scraper (or any other's, for that matter) without reading and understanding the Terms of Service of the target website. You are responsible for your own actions should you decide to use this.
